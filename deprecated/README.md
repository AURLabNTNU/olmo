# Deprecated files:

When making the repo we built a few files to check that we could hangle custom data and silcam files.

William never returned to these files, and they were never used on "real" data. As such they are not a part of the code, but may be a helpful starting point when we do return to ingesting silcam data (although that file will need to be re-written as a class similar to other sensors).
